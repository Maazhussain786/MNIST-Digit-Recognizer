# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
This project is a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras that can recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the popular MNIST dataset. It demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of training, evaluating, and testing a neural network on real-world handwritten digit images.
